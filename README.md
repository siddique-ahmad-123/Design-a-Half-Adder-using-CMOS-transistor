# Design-a-Half-Adder-using-CMOS-transistor
To design a Half Adder using CMOS transistors on Cadence Virtuoso, implement XOR and AND gates using PMOS and NMOS transistors. The XOR output provides the sum, and the AND output gives the carry. Simulate and verify the functionality by applying all binary input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11).
